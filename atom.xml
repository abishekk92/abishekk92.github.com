    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of my friends who are learning to code have been lamenting about how much they had to go through before they could get a proper installation of ruby and rails up and running. Though,there are a lot of blog posts or tutorials out there that try to help them,I don&#8217;t see them to be solving the problem. Infact there are packages like <a href="http://www.railsinstaller.org/">Rails installer</a> which litrelly provides an one click installation,however the installers seems only to be available for Mac OS X and Windows.</p>

<p>Hence,I wrote a quick script which downloads rvm,git,ruby,rails and other dependencies that are required. Let me warn you,it is very rudimentary,feel free to let me know if something didn&#8217;t work or something that I was stupid enough to miss. You can fork/clone <a href="https://github.com/abishekk92/box">Box</a> here.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a long struggle and a lot of convincing myself,I have decided to start bloggin seriously there by documenting the ideas,problems that I come across and how I go about solving them,my perspectives of different things and ofcourse rants.I still haven&#8217;t decided how often I would blog,it is still a debate going on with in me. Blogging as when and I do stuff seems to be a good way to go about it,let us see how that works out.</p>

<p>Let me sign of with those customary two words &#8220;Hello,World!&#8221;</p>
