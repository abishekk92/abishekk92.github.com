    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of my friends who are learning to code have been lamenting about how much they had to go through before they could get a proper installation of ruby and rails up and running. Though,there are a lot of blog posts or tutorials out there that try to help them,I don't see them to be solving the problem. Infact there are packages like <a href="http://www.railsinstaller.org/">Rails installer</a> which litrelly provides an one click installation,however the installers seems only to be available for Mac OS X and Windows.</p>

<p>Hence,I wrote a quick script which downloads rvm,git,ruby,rails and other dependencies that are required. Let me warn you,it is very rudimentary,feel free to let me know if something didn't work or something that I was stupid enough to miss. You can fork/clone <a href="https://github.com/abishekk92/box">Box</a> here.</p>
